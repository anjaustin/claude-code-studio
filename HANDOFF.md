# Claude Code Studio - Development Handoff

## Current State (2026-05-22)

All seven plan phases shipped. The app embeds Claude Code via node-pty
in resizable split panes, with sidebar panels for compact-controller,
commands, GitHub, LMM journaling, vault sync, account, cost tracking,
and settings. Auto-updater, system tray, command palette, snippets,
notifications, and rebindable hotkeys are wired in. Each phase carries
its own self-red-team review at the repo root (`SECURITY_REVIEW_*.md`).

## What's Working

### Phase 1: Shell + Terminal (COMPLETE)
- Electron 42 + React 19 + Vite + TypeScript foundation.
- node-pty spawns `claude.exe` with full ANSI support via xterm.js.
- Frameless window with custom title bar + window controls.
- Hardening (Phase 4 follow-up): CSP meta, sandbox: true,
  contextIsolation: true, navigation lockdown via `web-contents-created`.

### Phase 2: Resource Monitor (COMPLETE)
- `systeminformation` polls CPU/RAM/GPU every 2 s.
- Process-tree walking from Claude's root PID(s) — aggregates across
  multiple panes (Phase 7c).
- GaugeBar with dual-fill (purple = Claude, grey = system).

### Phase 3: Compact Controller (COMPLETE)
- Reads `~/.claude/compact-controller/state.json` for token/turn/vault
  counts.
- Toggle installs/uninstalls hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` with
  parse-failure refusal + `.bak` backup (Phase 4 C1 remediation).
- Exact-path hook matching (Phase 4 M4) so other users' similarly-named
  projects aren't false-positive matches.

### Phase 4: GitHub Integration (COMPLETE)
- `src/main/git-service.ts` — local git ops (branch/status/ahead/behind),
  parses GitHub owner/repo from origin URL, UNC + symlink hardening,
  5 s execFile timeout.
- `src/main/github-service.ts` — Octokit wrapper for repos/commits/
  branches/PRs/issues; PAT stored encrypted via Electron safeStorage
  (DPAPI on Windows), plaintext fallback requires explicit opt-in.
- GitHub panel: WorkingDirCard, ConnectGitHub, RepoHeader, CommitList,
  BranchList, PRList, IssueList.
- `shell.openExternal` URL allowlist (github.com / *.github.com).

### Phase 4.5: LMM Panel (COMPLETE)
- In-app sidebar panel walking the Lincoln Manifold Method
  (RAW → NODES → REFLECT → SYNTHESIZE) with toggle, journal-dir picker,
  variant (quick/deep) selector, persisted cycles.
- Path-traversal-safe cycle ids (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,79}$`).
- Per-file size cap, scan cap, cumulative cap on save.

### Phase 5: Auth + Cross-Device Settings Sync (COMPLETE)
- `src/main/auth-service.ts` with two backends behind one contract:
  `local-stub` (scrypt + safeStorage in userData) and `http` (POST
  register/login/logout, GET/PUT /settings against a configured
  https:// baseUrl — for a future Cloudflare Worker drop-in).
- "Continue without login" as primary CTA. GitHub PAT explicitly
  EXCLUDED from sync (device-local encryption key).
- Per-user sync file scoping (`auth-synced-settings.<uuid>.json`),
  NaN-safe expiry, pinned scrypt keylen, validated session shape.

### Phase 6: Vault Sync to Private GitHub Repo (COMPLETE)
- `src/main/cloud-sync.ts` watches `~/.claude/compact-controller/vault/`
  and pushes each `vault-*.json` to `deviceName/vault-*.json` in a
  user-chosen private GitHub repo. Setup wizard (create-new or
  use-existing) with consent gate + write-access verification.
- Per-file failure backoff (3 attempts then 15-min cooldown).
- "Uploads are append-only" warning + delete-remote-vault button.

### Phase 7a: Command Palette + Snippets + Notifications (COMPLETE)
- Ctrl+Shift+P palette with fuzzy-search across panels, themes,
  snippet inserts, terminal actions.
- Snippet store (CRUD + atomic JSON, 64 KB / 500 cap).
- Desktop notification service with per-kind throttling, settings
  toggles, and a test button.

### Phase 7b: Auto-Updater + Installer (COMPLETE)
- `src/main/updater-service.ts` wraps `update-electron-app` for GitHub
  Releases. Dev mode + non-Windows + user-disable gates.
- StatusBar "Update vX.Y.Z ready" badge; SettingsPanel Updates section
  with channel toggle, check-now (rate-limited), and reason copy.
- `forge.config.ts`: `PublisherGithub` (draft), Squirrel branding
  fields, commented signing/icon placeholders.

### Phase 7c: Split Panes + Session Persistence (COMPLETE)
- react-resizable-panels split tree with `PtyRegistry` (max 16 panes).
- Per-pane PTY with reattach-if-alive semantics. ResourceMonitor
  aggregates across all live panes.
- `SessionService` persists layout tree + active panel + theme to
  `<userData>/session.json` with depth/node caps + sanitization.
- Palette: Split horizontal/vertical, Close pane, Focus next/prev,
  Reset layout.

### Phase 7d: System Tray + Custom Hotkeys (COMPLETE)
- Tray icon (16x16 base64 PNG) + context menu (Show / Toggle Compact
  / Quit). Minimize-to-tray-on-close toggle.
- Shutdown consolidated into `before-quit` — closing the window while
  tray is on hides it (PTYs survive) instead of quitting.
- Rebindable shortcuts service: click-to-record chords, conflict
  detection, persisted in `<userData>/hotkeys.json`.

### Phase 7e: Token Cost Tracker (COMPLETE)
- `src/main/cost-service.ts` polls compact-controller state + vaults
  every 30 s. Per-session dedup, per-model rate table, daily totals.
- `CostPanel` with stat cards, 30-day inline-SVG sparkline, daily
  budget setting, reset history.
- Notification fires once per day when the budget is exceeded.
- In-panel disclaimer: estimates are a lower bound (vaults lack
  per-session output counts).

### UI Design (COMPLETE)
- Modern dark theme (#0f0f1a base) + 6 accent presets (Purple/Blue/
  Emerald/Rose/Amber/Cyan). Theme apply extracted to
  `src/renderer/theme-presets.ts` so SettingsPanel and CommandPalette
  share one source of truth.
- SVG icons everywhere; design tokens for radius/shadow/transition;
  fadeIn/slideIn animations.

## Shipping Status

Tagged ready to ship as **v1.0** on the `phase-7-integrated` branch.
See `SHIPPING_CERTIFICATION.md` for the certifying red-team output
(SHIP verdict, no Blockers / Criticals / Highs found).

## What's Next (post-v1.0 backlog)

Phase 7 closed the original plan. Items below are scoped as deferred
Mediums in the various `SECURITY_REVIEW_*.md` files, not v1.0 blockers.

1. **Tray icon HiDPI variants** — current tray icon is a single 16x16
   PNG; supply @2x for crisp Retina.
2. **Cost panel model awareness** — vault data doesn't record which
   model was used; cost is currently estimated against a single chosen
   model + an in-panel "lower-bound" disclaimer. Either ship a per-day
   model picker or accept the disclaimer permanently.
3. **Updater beta-channel pipeline** — UI was reduced to "stable" only
   (publisher pipeline is stable-only). To enable beta, split
   `update-electron-app` config + add a beta tag to GitHub Releases,
   then re-enable the channel picker in SettingsPanel.
4. **Multi-pane resource-monitor UI** — backend aggregates across all
   panes; ResourcePanel could optionally show a per-pane breakdown.
5. **macOS port** — Squirrel publisher is Windows-only today; macOS
   needs MakerDMG + code-signing + notarization, and Linux is
   unsupported by Squirrel-style auto-update.
6. **End-to-end installer verification** — `npm run package` exits 0
   and Vite production bundles all build, but the Forge packaging step
   was not verified on a regular Windows shell from this session
   (verified via SHIPPING_CERTIFICATION.md against `.vite/build/`
   artifacts). Run `npm run make` on a normal terminal to confirm the
   NSIS installer materializes.

### Already-closed Mediums (no longer open work)
- ✅ Hotkey cold-start window — hardcoded Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P fallback
  in `App.tsx` works regardless of bindings state.
- ✅ Session migration scaffold — `SessionService.migrate()` handles
  forward-version bumps and "from-the-future" files (refuse + default).
- ✅ electron-store ESM landmine — dep removed entirely.
- ✅ Unattended-toast warning — SettingsPanel tray copy now warns that
  background services keep running while hidden.

## Branch Layout
- `master` — original Phase 1–3 base
- `phase-4-github-integration` — Phase 4 PR
- `phase-4.5-lmm-panel`        — Phase 4.5 PR
- `phase-5-auth`               — Phase 5 PR
- `phase-6-vault-sync`         — Phase 6 PR
- `phase-7a-palette-snippets-notifications` — Phase 7a PR
- `phase-7b-auto-updater`, `-7c-split-panes-session`,
  `-7d-tray-hotkeys`, `-7e-cost-tracker` — individual sub-feature PRs
- **`phase-7-integrated`** — recommended merge target: all of 7b–e
  merged on top of 7a, plus a cross-feature red-team pass

## Workflow Conventions
- LMM applied as a thinking discipline on non-trivial work (see
  `journal/` for per-file analyses).
- Red-team + remediate after each phase before commit. Every phase has
  a self-review at `SECURITY_REVIEW_*.md` listing the Criticals + Highs
  fixed in the same commit set, with Mediums explicitly deferred as
  documented tech debt.
- Worktree-isolated agents per phase (see Phase 7b–e). Integration
  happens in a `phase-N-integrated` branch with a final cross-feature
  review.
